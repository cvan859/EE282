## Genome Assembly
md5sum output: `dmel-all-chromosome-r6.48.fasta.gz: OK`

1. There are 137,547,960 total nucleotides counting all the chromosome arms.
2. There are 268 total Ns. If every chromosome arm is split on an N (using faSplitByN), there should be one less N than the number of contigs reported back for each arm.
3. Theare are 1870 sequences contained the fasta.gz file, including 7 chromosome arms, 25 mapped scaffolds, and 22 unmapped scaffolds, leaving 1816 contigs.

1. There are 3497 different features, in order from most common to least common:
    1. 
2. There are the following number of genes per chromosome arm:
    - X
    - Y
    - 2L
    - 2R
    - 3L
    - 3R
    - 4
